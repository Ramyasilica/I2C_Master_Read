# I2C_Master_Read

🌍 Welcome World!

Welcome to my **sixth GitHub repository** 🎉

This project presents an **I2C Master Read controller** implemented using **Verilog HDL** and verified through **simulation waveform analysis**.
This repository is created to **understand and implement the I2C read operation at RTL level**, focusing on correct timing, open-drain behavior, and successful data reception from an I2C slave.


📌 What is I2C?

**I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a synchronous serial communication protocol that uses only **two wires**:
* **SCL** – Serial Clock Line
* **SDA** – Serial Data Line

It is widely used for communication between **microcontrollers, sensors, EEPROMs, RTCs, and other peripherals**.
Key characteristics:
* Master–slave architecture
* Open-drain communication
* Byte-oriented data transfer

## Project Overview

In this repository, I have implemented an **I2C Master Read operation**.

The main goal of this project is to:
* Demonstrate how an I2C master **reads data from a slave**
* Understand **bit-level data transfer**
* Verify the design using **simulation waveforms**

This project explains the **I2C read operation flow**, starting from transaction initiation to successful data reception.

## I2C Master Read – Concept

In an **I2C Master Read** operation:
* The **master controls the clock (SCL)**
* The **slave places data on SDA**
* The master samples data on valid clock edges
* Data is transferred **MSB first**, one byte at a time

This design focuses on a **single-byte read operation** to clearly understand protocol fundamentals.


## Signals Used (From Simulation Waveform)

### Control Signals

* `clk` – System clock
* `rst` – Reset signal
* `start` – Initiates I2C transaction
* `busy` – Indicates active read operation

### I2C Bus Signals

* `scl` – Serial clock generated by master
* `sda` – Serial data line (open-drain)

### Data & Status Signals

* `slave_data[7:0]` – Data driven by slave
* `data_out[7:0]` – Data captured by master
* `bit_cnt[3:0]` – Bit counter for read operation


## Working of the I2C Master Read Operation
1. System clock starts toggling
2. Reset is released
3. `start` signal initiates the I2C transaction
4. Master generates the I2C clock (`scl`)
5. Slave drives data onto the `sda` line
6. Master samples data on clock edges
7. Bit counter tracks 8-bit data transfer
8. Received data is stored in `data_out`
9. Transaction completes after one byte read


## 📊 Simulation Results (Waveform Analysis)

From the simulation waveform:
* `scl` toggles with proper timing
* `sda` follows open-drain behavior
* `bit_cnt` counts from **7 down to 0**
* Slave sends data `0xA5`
* Master successfully captures `data_out = 0xA5`

*  Correct data reception
* Proper clock-data relationship
* Successful I2C master read operation

This confirms that the **I2C read logic works as expected**.
